Atlas Consolidated Mining & Development Corporation (AT) was incorporated as Masbate Consolidated Mining Company, Inc. on March 9, 1935 as a result of the merger of assets and equities of three pre-war mining companies, namely, Masbate Consolidated Mining Company Inc., Antamok Goldfields Mining Company, and IXL Mining Company. Thereafter, AT amended its articles of incorporation to reflect the present corporate name.<br/><br/>AT&#39;s only significant subsidiary is Carmen Copper Corporation (CCC), through which it is engaged in metallic mining and mineral exploration and development. Since the resumption of commercial mining operations in Toledo in 2008, CCC has been shipping its copper to smelters in China and South Korea, pursuant to its offtake agreements with MRI Trading AG (MRI). In 2013, it began delivering copper concentrate to the plant of the Philippine Associated Smelting and Refining Corporation in Leyte, Ocean Partners UK Ltd., and to smelters in Japan by virtue of an offtake contract with Mitsui & Co.
