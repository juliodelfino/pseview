Greenergy Holdings Incorporated (GREEN) was originally incorporated as MUSX Corporation (MSC) on January 29, 1992. GREEN was established to engage in the creation, design, development and manufacture of specialty semiconductor products and to market and sell the same to customers worldwide. However, in 1999, with the approval of its shareholders, the Company became a holding company which lasted until 2003, when it reverted to its prior state, being a semiconductor operating company. <br/><br/>On December 15, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the change in GREEN&#39;s primary purpose from a semiconductor company to a holding company. In the latter part of 2010, under a new management, GREEN began its initiative in venturing into other business opportunities apart from the semiconductor business. One of these business opportunities pertain to the field of renewable energy. In June 22, 2011, the SEC approved the Company&#39;s proposal to change the corporate name to the present one.<br/><br/>In 2012, GREEN established subsidiaries to mark its venture into the field of renewable energy. These subsidiaries are Biomass Holdings, Inc.; Winsun Green Ventures Inc.; Total Waste Management Recovery System, Inc.; and Isabela Alcogas Corporation.<br/><br/>Recently, the Stockholders of GREEN approved the investment of the Company in other green businesses. Among the businesses being considered for acquisition or investment that would allow GREEN to widen and diversify its investment portfolio are those in the area of agriculture, agri-tourism, real estate development, banking and finance, and information technology.<br/><br/>Source: The Company (2014)/SEC Form 17-A (2013)
