Founded in 1851, Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) was incorporated on January 4, 1943 and went public on October 12, 1971. Post World War II, BPI evolved from a purely commercial bank to a fully diversified universal bank with activities encompassing traditional commercial banking as well as investment and consumer banking. This transformation was accomplished mainly through mergers and acquisitions when it absorbed an investment house, a stock brokerage, a leasing company, a savings bank, and a retail finance company, and bancassurance platforms.<br/><br/>The Company has two major categories for products and services. The first category covers its core financial intermediation business, which includes deposit taking, lending, and securities investments. The second category covers services ancillary to the Company&#39;s financial intermediation business, and from which it derives transaction-based commissions, service charges and other fees. <br/><br/>BPI&#39;s principal subsidiaries are BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc.; BPI Capital Corporation; BPI Direct Savings Bank; BPI International Finance Limited; BPI (Europe) Plc.; BPI Century Tokyo Lease & Finance Corp.; and BPI/MS Insurance Corp. <br/><br/>As of December 31, 2015, BPI has 814 branches, including 45 kiosk branches, one branch in Hong Kong and four branches in London. BPI also has 2,210 ATMs and 550 cash accept machines. Additionally, there are four BPI Globe BanKO branches set up in strategic locations in the country. <br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)
