Oriental Petroleum and Minerals Corporation (OPM) was incorporated on December 22, 1969 with the purpose of exploring, developing and producing petroleum and mineral resources in the Philippines. As an exploration company, OPM&#39;s operational activities depend principally on its service contracts (SCs) with the Philippine government.<br/><br/>OPM&#39;s petroleum revenues and production and related expenses are derived from SC 14 Contract Area, which is composed of four blocks, namely, A (Nido), B (Matinloc), C (Galoc & West Linapacan) and D. Of these blocks, only blocks of Nido, Matinloc and Galoc are in operation. West Linapacan is currently under evaluation for re-activation after it was shut-in in 1991 due to water intrusion, and Block D is designated as the retention block.<br/><br/>OPM has three wholly-owned subsidiaries namely, Oriental Mahogany Woodworks, Inc., Linapacan Oil Gas and Power Corporation, and Oriental Land Corporation.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)<br/>
