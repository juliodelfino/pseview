Concrete Aggregates Corporation (CA) was originally incorporated on January 16, 1959 as Concrete Aggregates, Inc. and later merged with Build-On Aggregates Corporation in 1973 to form CA. The Company supplies the construction industry with processed aggregates, ready mix concrete, bituminous concrete mix, and pre-stressed/pre-cast concrete. CA&#39;s parent company is Ortigas & Company, Limited Partnership, and its ultimate parent company is OCLP Holdings Incorporated, which are both domiciled in the Philippines.<br/><br/>CA was able to purchase and operate two ready mix concrete (RMC) plants, three bituminous concrete mix (BCM) plants, four aggregates quarry/crushing plants, and three pre-stressed/pre-cast concrete plants. However, the Company was hit by the economic crisis in 1998, and on September 14, 1999, the Board of CA approved the total and complete closure of the Engineering and Construction Division of the Company, which were comprised of the RMC, BCM, concrete products and construction groups.<br/><br/>Prior to the effectivity of the operating agreement with Batong Angono Aggregates Corporation (BAAC) on June 1, 2008 that grants BAAC the right to operate the Angono quarry for 15 years, CA directly operated its aggregates plants - the source of its quality aggregates - which are nestled at the foot of the mountains in the outskirts of Barangay San Isidro and San Roque in Angono, Rizal. Upon assumption by BAAC as the Company&#39;s quarry operator, CA&#39;s income from the quarry operations will be the royalty payments made by BAAC at the rate agreed upon by the parties. In late 2013, BAAC changed its name to Lafarge Republic Aggregates, Inc., and in 2015, LRAI once again changed its name to Lafarge Holcim Aggregates, Inc. (LHAI).<br/><br/>The Company&#39;s wholly-owned subsidiaries are CAC Insurance Agency Corp. and CAC Marketing and Services Corp.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)
