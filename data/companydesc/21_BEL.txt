Belle Corporation (BEL) was originally incorporated in 1973 as Belle Mining and Oil Exploration, Incorporated (Belle Resources). In 1989, Belle Resources developed a golf club named Tagaytay Highlands International Golf Club, Incorporated, which became its initial foray into the property development sector. Thereafter, Belle Resources changed its name to the present one in 1994 to underscore the shift in its principal activity.<br/><br/>BEL&#39;s property development projects are located in Tagaytay City and Batangas, which include, among others, Alta Mira, Fairfield, Lakeside Fairways, Lakeview Heights, Nobhill, Pinecrest Village, Plantation Hills, Tagaytay Highlands Golf Club, Tagaytay Midlands Golf Club, The Belleview, The Country Club at Tagaytay Highlands, The Parks at Saratoga Hills, The Spa and Lodge at Tagaytay Highlands, The Verandas at Saratoga Hills, The Villas, and The Woodlands.<br/><br/>On April 14, 2011, BEL acquired Premium Leisure & Amusement, Inc. (PLAI). PLAI is a grantee by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) of a license to operate integrated resorts, including casinos, in the vicinity of the Bagong Nayong Pilipino Manila Bay Entertainment City (Entertainment City) and the Newport City Integrated Resort.<br/><br/>In October 2012, BEL and PLAI entered into a cooperation agreement with MCE, which places BEL as a co-licensee and the owner of the land and buildings and MCE as a co-licensee and developer and operator of all the facilities within the resort complex effective March 13, 2013. A year later, MCE unveiled plans to name the integrated resort "City of Dreams Manila" after its flagship City of Dreams integrated resort in Macau&#39;s Cotai Strip. City of Dreams Manila was launched on February 2, 2015. In May 2015, City of Dreams Manila became the first integrated resort in Entertainment City to have its license converted from Provisional to Regular status by PAGCOR.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)<br/>
