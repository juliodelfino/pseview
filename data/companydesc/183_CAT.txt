The slops from the distillery are also captured by the carbon dioxide plant to produce liquid carbon dioxide also in tandem with the distillery.<br/><br/>The Company owns a 100% stake in Luisita Land Corporation (LLC), a domestic corporation engaged in developing, leasing, and selling real properties and other ancillary services.
