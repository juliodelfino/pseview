Incorporated on Novermber 20, 1990, MRC Allied, Inc. (MRC), formerly Makilala Rubber Corporation, is a property development firm in the Philippines which is engaged in the development of master planned, integrated residential, commercial, recreational, tourism and industrial areas within a single community or township. On July 21, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the change in corporate name to the present one.<br/><br/>The Company&#39;s activities were originally involved in the processing and export of baled natural rubber. In 1993, new stockholders acquired the Company from Philtread Tire & Rubber Corporation and diversified the Company into real property development, particularly into township development. In 1997, MRC decided to sell its rubber business to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Makrubber Corporation (Makrubber), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to focus on its core business of real property development. However, in 2000, Makrubber stopped its commercial operation due to the worsening of the raw material supply and the problem of peace and order in the Mindanao area.<br/><br/>At present, the principal asset of the Company consists of two land banks. The first is a 160-hectare industrial estate in Naga City, Cebu and the second consists of 700 hectare of raw land in San Isidro Municipality, Leyte. Located 35 kilometers away from the Mactan International Airport, the industrial estate in Naga City, known as the New Cebu Township One, is registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority as a special economic zone.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)<br/>
