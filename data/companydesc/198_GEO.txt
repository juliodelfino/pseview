GEOGRACE Resources Philippines, Inc. (GEO) was incorporated as La Suerte Gold Mining Corporation (LSGMC) on April 20, 1970 initially to engage in the mining business. On May 1995, the stockholders of LSGMC approved the realignment of the Company&#39;s main business activities from that of a mining company to that of an investment holding company, and the change in the Company&#39;s name from LSGMC to Global Equities, Inc. However, in 2006, the Company shifted its primary purpose back to mining and exploration of mineral resources and changed its corporate name to its present name. In 2013, the Board of GEO and its shareholders approved the amendment of changing the Company&#39;s primary purpose again from a mining company into a holding company, which was then approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2014.<br/><br/>GEO entered into two operating agreements covering operating mining claims with valid and subsisting Mineral Production and Sharing Agreements and a number of heads of agreement to acquire rights to explore, develop and operate mining claims. At present, the Company is operating the Masbate mining claims located in the province of Masbate and the Zambales mining claims in the province of Zambales.<br/><br/>GEO owns 97% of Abeilles Assets, Inc.
