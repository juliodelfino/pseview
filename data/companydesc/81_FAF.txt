First Abacus Financial Holdings Corporation (FAF) traces its roots from Seven Seas Oil Exploration and Resources, Inc. (SSOERI), which was incorporated on February 15, 1994. The Company was primarily engaged in the business of oil exploration and development. On January 25, 1996, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Company&#39;s change in corporate name from SSOERI to its present name, including a change in primary purpose into a financial holding company.<br/><br/>FAF&#39;s first strategic corporate realignment move was the acquisition of Abacus Capital & Investment Corporation (ACIC), an operating investment house. The acquisition of ACIC also brought into FAF the subsidiaries of ACIC, namely, Abacus Securities Corporation (ASC) and Vista Holdings Corporation (VHC).<br/><br/>FAF, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in stockbroking activities, investment banking, real estate business, and other financial services. ACIC is primarily engaged in investment banking activities, management services, and treasury and other financial services. ASC is engaged in stock brokering services, while VHC is engaged in buying and leasing out condominium units but currently is not investing in any real estate property due to the market condition.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)<br/>
