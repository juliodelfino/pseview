Shakey&apos;s Pizza Asia Ventures, Inc. (PIZZA) was incorporated and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 1974 originally as International Family Food Services, Inc. The Company&apos;s primary purpose is to operate and maintain food parlors under the "Shakey&apos;s" brand, which was founded by Sherwood "Shakey" Johnson and Ed Plummer in Sacramento, California, USA in 1954.<br/>    <br/>PIZZA is the exclusive franchise holder of the Shakey&apos;s Pizza Restaurant business in the Philippines with its first store opened in 1975. The Company is previously owned by the Prieto family, through their entity Antelope Enterprises, Inc. In 1999, Golden Gourmet Ltd. (GGL), an entity also owned by the Prieto family, purchased the Shakey&apos;s trademark and acquired perpetual rights over the brand in the Philippines from Shakey&apos;s International, Ltd. (SIL). As owner, the Prieto family would no longer be required to pay royalties or other fees for using the Shakey&apos;s brand.<br/><br/>In 2003, Shakey&apos;s stores were relaunched as a casual family restaurant. To have better control of the supply chain, the Prieto family established Bakemasters, Inc. (BMI) in October 2005 to supply baked goods and ingredients to Shakey&apos;s outlets. In 2014, the Prieto family acquired SIL, which holds the Shakey&apos;s trademarks for countries in the Middle East, China and other countries in Asia (excluding Japan and Malaysia), as well as Australia and New Zealand.<br/><br/>In March 2016, Century Pacific Group, Inc. (CPG), the holding company of the Po family, and Arran Investment Pte Ltd. acquired control of the Shakey&apos;s Group from the Prieto family through its acquisition vehicle, Shakey&apos;s Asia Food Holdings, Inc. The transaction included control over PIZZA, BMI, GGL and SIL, as well as DBE Project, Inc., the operator of the Project Pie artisan pizza chain. <br/><br/>As of June 30, 2016, PIZZA has 177 Shakey&apos;s stores nationwide, of which 106 were Company-owned and 71 were franchised to third parties.<br/><br/>Source: Prospectus (2016)
