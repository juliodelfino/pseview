National Reinsurance Corporation of the Philippines (NRCP) was incorporated on June 7, 1978 as a professional reinsurance corporation providing life and non-life reinsurance to the Philippines and neighboring insurance markets. In 2007, the Company received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to do business under the names and styles of "Philippine National Reinsurance Company" or "PhilNaRe" to reinforce its image as the country&#39;s national reinsurer and its position as the only domestically-incorporated professional reinsurance company in the country.<br/><br/>The primary mandate of NRCP is to assist in the development of the Philippine insurance industry by providing reinsurance capacity and support to Philippine insurance companies, by serving as a medium for regional and international cooperation in insurance, and by contributing towards higher retention of business within the country. The Company became a vehicle for the Philippine insurance industry&#39;s participation in the Asian Reinsurance Corporation, a multilateral reinsurance entity based in Bangkok, Thailand established to foster regional cooperation among insurance companies doing business in Asia.<br/><br/>NRCP writes both life and non-life reinsurance. Major business lines under the non-life group include fire, marine & aviation, and casualty & others.
