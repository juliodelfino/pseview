Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation (SHLPH) was incorporated and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 9, 1959 originally as The Shell Refining Company (Philippines), Inc. In 1973, the Company was renamed to the present one. SHLPH is primarily engaged in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. The Company&apos;s products include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, fuel oil, lubricants and bitumen.<br/><br/>SHLPH is organized into three operating segments namely, retail, commercial, and manufacturing and supply. The Company employs two kinds of format for its retail segment, and these are the company-owned-dealer-operated retail service stations (CODO) and dealer-owned-dealer-operated retail service stations (DODO).

These include Pandacan Depots Services, Inc., which manages and operates storage, handling and distribution facilities; Bonifacio Gas Corporation, which constructs, maintains and operates a centralized gas distribution system; and Kamayan Realty Corporation, which acquires, develops and manages real estate properties. <br/><br/>Some of the Company&apos;s products are "Shell FuelSave Gasoline"; "Shell FuelOil Plus"; "Shell Helix"; "Shell Rimula"; and "Shell Naturelle".
