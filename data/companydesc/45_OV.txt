The Philodrill Corporation (OV) was incorporated on June 26, 1969 with the primary purpose of engaging in oil, gas, and mineral exploration and development. In 1989, realizing the need to balance the risk associated with its petroleum activities, OV changed its primary purpose to that of a diversified holding company while retaining petroleum and mineral exploration and development as one of its secondary purposes. On April 13, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the change in the Company&#39;s primary purpose back to petroleum exploration and development and to relegate and include as a secondary purpose the Company&#39;s holding company purpose clause.<br/><br/>The Company&#39;s active petroleum projects cover production and exploration areas in offshore Palawan and South Sulu Sea and onshore Mindoro under various service contracts with the Philippine government through the Department of Energy.<br/><br/>OV has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Phoenix Gas and Exploration Co., Inc., which has not yet started commercial operations as of end-2015. OV is a 40% shareholder of Penta Capital Investment Corporation, an investment house which holds equity interest in companies that are engaged in finance, investments and realty. OV also holds minor equity interests in Atlas Consolidated Mining & Development Corporation, Vulcan Industrial & Mining Corporation, and United Paragon Mining Corporation.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)<br/>
