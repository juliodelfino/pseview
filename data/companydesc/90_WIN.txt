Wellex Industries, Inc. (WIN) was originally incorporated on October 19, 1956 as Republic Resources and Development Corporation to primarily engage in the business of mining and oil exploration. Beset by difficulties experienced by the oil and mining industries during the 1980s, the Company&#39;s pursuit of activities to revitalize itself led to the entry of The Wellex Group, Inc. in 1994. The Company was subsequently transformed into a holding company for manufacturing concerns, and changed its name to the present one on September 18, 1997.<br/><br/>The Company&#39;s two subsidiaries, Plastic City Industrial Corporation (PCIC) and Philfoods Asia, Inc., have temporarily ceased their manufacturing and commercial operations due to continued losses in 2002. PCIC subsidiaries, however, have leased out its warehouse and building facilities located in Rizal. WIN&#39;s present activity is focused on reorganizing its operations and maintaining its equipment and facilities in preparation for the resumption of its operations. The Company is currently looking for strategic partners whether local or foreign to operate the PCIC plant.<br/><br/>On November 20, 2008, the Board and stockholders of WIN approved the amendment of the Company&#39;s primary purpose to employment of capital for the purpose of assisting mining enterprises. The Company&#39;s secondary purpose, however, remains for operation of all types of business enterprises, such as property holding and development, management, manufacturing, investments and other business. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the amendment on April 3, 2009.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)
