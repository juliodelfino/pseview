International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICT) was incorporated on December 24, 1987 to operate, manage and develop the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT), which handles international container cargo at the Port of Manila. In May 1988, the Philippine Ports Authority awarded to ICT a concession to be the exclusive operator of MICT for a period of 25 years. ICT started operating MICT on June 12, 1988. ICT&#39;s concession contract for MICT was extended for another 25 years up to May 18, 2038. <br/><br/>The principal business of ICT is the operation, management, development and acquisition of container terminals. The primary mechanism for the operation of these terminals is long-term concession agreements with local port authorities and governments through ICT and its subsidiaries. ICT and its subsidiaries also provide a number of ancillary services such as storage, container stripping and stuffing, inspection, weighing and services for refrigerated containers or reefers, as well as roll-on/roll-off and anchorage services to non-containerized cargoes or general cargoes on a limited basis.<br/><br/>Currently, ICT is involved in 30 terminal concessions and port development projects in 20 countries worldwide. These are 25 operating terminals in eight key ports and an inland container terminal in the Philippines, two in Indonesia and one each in Brunei, China, the US, Ecuador, Brazil, Poland, Georgia, Madagascar, Croatia, Pakistan, Mexico, Honduras, Iraq and Argentina; three ongoing port development projects in Colombia, DR Congo and Australia; a sub-concession agreement to develop, manage and operate a port in Nigeria; and a recent acquisition of an existing concession to construct and operate a port in Tuxpan, Mexico. <br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)
