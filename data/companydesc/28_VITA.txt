Vitarich Corporation (VITA) was incorporated and organized on July 31, 1962. The forerunner of VITA was established in 1950 by the brothers Feliciano, Lorenzo and Pablo Sarmiento, when they founded Philippine American Milling Co. Inc. (PAMCO). PAMCO eventually moved from its original location to a more modern feed plant in Marilao, Bulacan, marking the beginning of VITA&#39;s fully integrated operations and the trade name "Vitarich" was subsequently adopted. In 1962, the Company was registered with Securities and Exchange Commission under the name Vitarich Feedmill, Inc., after PAMCO acquired additional machinery and equipment to increase capacity.<br/><br/>VITA is presently engaged in the production and distribution of various poultry products such as live and dressed chicken, day-old chicks and animal and aqua feeds, among others. As an integral poultry producer, the Company oversees every aspect of the poultry production process from breeding and hatching to processing to sales. In 2014, the Company&#39;s Board of Directors approved the disposal of its major feed mill and the land where it is located in Marilao, Bulacan and several noncore assets. The proceeds were used to further reduce outstanding liabilities and generate needed working capital.<br/><br/>The Company&#39;s subsidiaries are Philippine&#39;s Favorite Chicken, Inc. (PFCI), and Gromax, Inc. (Gromax). PFCI ceased commercial operations in 2005. Gromax, on the other hand, continues to engage in the manufacture and distribution of animal health and nutritional feeds. Operating offices of the Company are located in some parts of Luzon, in Iloilo and in Davao, and various satellite offices in some parts of Southern Philippines.<br/><br/>As at November 5, 2015, the Company filed with the Rehabilitation Court a motion to exit the rehabilitation plan.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)
