Vivant Corporation (VVT) was incorporated on May 28, 1990. The Company, through subsidiaries and affiliates, has interests in various companies engaged in the electric power generation (renewable and non-renewable energy), electric power distribution, and retail electricity supply business. The entry into the power industry dates back to the early 1900s when the Garcia-Esca&#241;o Family of Cebu diversified their business interests (mainly shipping and trade) to include electricity power distribution when it took over the operations of the Visayas Electric Company (VECO).<br/><br/>Starting in 2007, VVT, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, started its foray into the power generation business via equity investments in the following generation companies: Cebu Private Power Corporation, owner and operator of a 70 megawatts (MW) diesel-fired power plant located in the island of Cebu; Delta P, Inc., owner and operator of a 16 MW diesel-fired power plant in Palawan; and Cebu Energy Development Corporation, a project company that owns and operates a 246 MW coal-fired power plant in Toledo City, Cebu.<br/><br/>As of end-2015, the Company&#39;s subsidiary, Vivant Energy Corporation, holds all of its interests in the electric power generation business. To date, VVT has built a portfolio of both renewable and non-renewable power generation plants with total attributable capacity of 252 MW. The Company established two companies that are to become retail electricity suppliers pursuant to the implementation of the open access and retail competition under the EPIRA Law. These companies are Prism Energy, Inc. and Corenergy, Inc.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)<br/>
