Cyber Bay Corporation (CYBR) was organized to undertake real estate development (except real estate subdivision) and reclamation. The Company was incorporated on July 6, 1989 and changed its name from First Lepanto Corporation to Guoco Land (Philippines), Inc. in 1994, to Centennial City Inc. in 1996, and to the present one in 2000.<br/><br/>On March 30, 1996, CYBR, Central Bay Reclamation and Development Corporation (CBRDC) and certain CBRDC shareholders entered into a memorandum of agreement which involved the restructuring of CYBR and the consolidation of certain businesses and assets of CYBR and CBRDC.<br/><br/>The restructuring of CYBR entailed the transfer to Prime Orion Philippines, Inc. of CYBR&#39;s investments in certain corporations and the settlement of all intercompany liabilities relating to such corporations. Upon completion of the business consolidation, CYBR assumed full ownership of CBRDC, including its joint venture agreement (JVA) with the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA) to reclaim 750 hectares of land along Manila Bay (the Cyber Bay Project) as its new property core holding.<br/><br/>However, CYBR got into a legal battle with the government concerning the ownership of the CBRDC. The issue had also put on hold the JVA for the Company&#39;s Cyber Bay Project. On November 20, 2009, CYBR sent a letter to the PRA requesting for the initial payment, representing all costs, losses, liabilities, and expenses incurred by CBRDC computed as of September 2009 pursuant to the amended JVA.<br/><br/>CYBR has suspended all works and negotiations due to the decision of the Supreme Court nullifying the JVA, through the efforts of its outsourced service provider, consolidate all the records pertaining to the claim for reimbursement from the PRA.<br/><br/>As of December 31, 2015, CYBR has not yet received any updates from PRA and COA with regards to the status of the claim for reimbursement.<br/><br/>Source: SEC Form 17-A (2015)<br/>
